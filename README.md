## Project Overview

UDAKARGALAM is a modern, responsive, and accessible website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be a clean and professional platform for a research presentation, with support for English and Sanskrit languages.

**Key Features:**
- **Bilingual Support:** Full content internationalization for Sanskrit (default) and English.
- **Dynamic Homepage:** A full-screen hero with a looping ocean video and an animated SVG fallback for users who prefer reduced motion.
- **PDF Library:** A dedicated page to showcase and link to research papers in various languages.
- **Accessible Design:** Adheres to accessibility best practices, including keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and high-contrast design.
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18.x or later. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** or **yarn**: A package manager for Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd udakargalam
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application. The site will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Project Structure

The project uses the Next.js App Router. Here is a brief overview of the key directories:

```

│   ├── /media/         # Static media like videos and SVGs
│   └── /pdfs/          # Placeholder PDFs and thumbnails
├── /src/
│   ├── /app/           # Main application routes and layouts
│   ├── /components/    # Reusable React components
│   ├── /context/       # React context for state management (e.g., locale)
│   ├── /hooks/         # Custom React hooks
│   ├── /lib/           # Utility functions and data definitions
│   └── /locales/       # JSON files for internationalization (i18n)
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── README.md
```

## Replacing Placeholder Content

This project is set up with placeholder content. Follow these steps to replace it with your own.

### Text Content (i18n)

All text content is managed in the `/src/locales/` directory.

1.  **Sanskrit Content:** Edit `/src/locales/sa.json`.
2.  **English Content:** Edit `/src/locales/en.json`.

The JSON files contain key-value pairs for all text on the site, from navigation labels to page content. Simply update the string values.

### Homepage Video

The homepage hero video is located at `/public/media/ocean.mp4`.

1.  **Replace the video:** Place your new video file (e.g., a short, looping `.mp4`) at the same location, overwriting `ocean.mp4`.
2.  **Fallback SVG:** The file `/public/media/ocean-fallback.svg` is an animated SVG used as a fallback. You can replace this as well if you wish.

### PDFs and Thumbnails

The "Grantha / ग्रन्थाः" page displays a list of PDFs.

1.  **Add Your PDFs:** Place your PDF files inside the `/public/pdfs/` directory.
2.  **Update PDF Data:** Open `/src/lib/pdf-data.ts`. This file contains an array of objects, where each object defines a PDF to be displayed. Update the `file` path for each entry to match your new PDF filenames.
    ```typescript
    export const pdfs = [
      {
        id: 'samskrita',
        localeKey: 'samskrita',
        name: 'Samskrita / संस्कृतम्',
        file: '/pdfs/your-sanskrit-file.pdf', // <-- UPDATE THIS
        thumbId: 'pdf-thumb-1'
      },
      // ... more pdfs
    ];
    ```
3.  **Update Thumbnails (Optional):** The thumbnails are placeholder images. If you have custom thumbnail images (e.g., PNGs of the PDF cover pages), place them in `/public/pdfs/thumbs/` and update the image paths in `/src/lib/placeholder-images.json`.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile and optimize the application into a `.next` directory.

## Deployment to Hostinger

You can deploy this Next.js application to Hostinger using either Node.js hosting or as a static site.

### Option 1: Node.js Hosting (Recommended)

This method provides the full functionality of Next.js, including Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

1.  **Prepare Your Project:**
    - Run `npm run build` locally to ensure everything builds correctly.
    - Create a `.zip` file of your entire project directory, making sure to include `.next`, `public`, `node_modules`, and `package.json`.

2.  **Upload to Hostinger:**
    - Log in to your Hostinger hPanel.
    - Navigate to **Files** -> **File Manager**.
    - Upload the `.zip` file to your `public_html` directory (or your desired subdirectory).
    - Right-click the `.zip` file and select **Extract** to unpack your project files.

3.  **Set Up Node.js Environment:**
    - In hPanel, go to **Advanced** -> **Node.js**.
    - Click **Create Application**.
    - Set the **Application startup file** to `node_modules/.bin/next`.
    - Set the **Application mode** to `Production`.
    - Click **Save**. Hostinger will install dependencies from your `package.json` and start the application.

4.  **Access Your Site:**
    - Once the application is running, you can access it via your domain. Hostinger will manage running the `npm start` command for you.

### Option 2: Static Site Hosting

This method exports your site as static HTML, which is simpler but loses SSR capabilities. This is not recommended if you have pages that require server-side logic.

1.  **Configure for Static Export:**
    - In your `next.config.ts` file, add the following line:
      ```typescript
      output: 'export',
      ```
    - This tells Next.js to generate static HTML files.

2.  **Build the Static Site:**
    - Run the build command:
      ```bash
      npm run build
      ```
    - This will create a static version of your site in the `out` directory.

3.  **Upload to Hostinger:**
    - In hPanel, navigate to **Files** -> **File Manager**.
    - Go to your `public_html` directory.
    - Upload all the contents of your local `out` directory into `public_html`.

4.  **Access Your Site:**
    - Your site is now live and can be accessed via your domain.

**Note on Subfolders:** If you deploy to a subfolder (e.g., `yourdomain.com/research`), you will need to configure `basePath` in your `next.config.ts` file before building.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server (after building).
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase for errors.

## Testing Checklist

Before going live, perform these checks:

- [ ] **Cross-Device Check:**
  - [ ] **Desktop:** Verify layout, navigation, and all interactive elements.
  - [ ] **Tablet:** Check for proper responsive adjustments.
  - [ ] **Mobile:** Ensure the mobile navigation works and content is readable.
- [ ] **Language Toggle:**
  - [ ] Confirm the toggle switches between Sanskrit and English.
  - [ ] Refresh a page and ensure your language choice persists.
  - [ ] Open the site in a new incognito window and confirm it defaults to Sanskrit.
- [ ] **PDF Links:**
  - [ ] On the "Grantha" page, click each card and verify it opens the correct PDF in a new browser tab.
- [ ] **Homepage Video:**
  - [ ] Check that the video autoplays and loops correctly.
- [ ] **Accessibility:**
  - [ ] Navigate the entire site using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter).
  - [ ] Use a screen reader to test a few pages for clarity.
  - [ ] Check your browser's developer tools to simulate `prefers-reduced-motion` and ensure the animated SVG fallback appears on the homepage.
